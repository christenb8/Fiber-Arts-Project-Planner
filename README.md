# Product Specification
This app will be a project planner app specifically for fiber arts activites. It will include information about every project the user has made and logged. This will include things like yarn used, tools used, time taken to complete the project, and what pattern was used. The purpose of this app is to keep information about completed projects, how they were made (so they could be made again), and to track progress on current projects. The target users are knitters and crocheters. The specific need that my project addresses is the need for a project tracker that has all of the info needed to complete a project in one app and includes the time of each update. Personally, I go through multiple apps just to keep track of my progress, plan my ideas, look at my pattern, search up techniques, and save ideas on projects I would like to do. With this app, users will have everything they need in one place. 

## ðŸ§¶Core Features 
- Area to write down possible ideas and the possible materials/patterns needed
- Statistics about completed projects (For ex. What color yarn do you use most often? What types of projects do you gravitate towards?)
- Place to update progress on a pattern (while keeping track of the time last update)
- Instructions on techniques used in your pattern

## ðŸ§¶ Technical Overview
The database will keep information on the user and on the projects they have completed. In the frontend, users will be updating and requesting information. I will not integrate any APIs or external tools.
